# bacterial_plant_fungal_domain_analyzer
This repository contains a datascience based faster implementation of the domain predictions from the interpro scan and it will give you a complete domains information, coordinates and other associative information. I used a mapping dataframe approach to make it faster rather than looping it over and over.
